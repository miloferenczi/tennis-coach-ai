Tennis Stroke Technique Diagnostic Decision Tree
Low Racquet Speed
Symptom Pattern: Racquet velocity consistently in the low range (e.g. Velocity < 0.4 on a 0–1 scale) with low acceleration. Often combined with long swing preparation (player starts swing late) and minimal body rotation. For example, Velocity < 0.035 AND Preparation time > 1.2s indicates a very slow, late swing.
Root Cause: Insufficient use of the kinetic chain – the player is “arming” the ball instead of engaging legs and torso. Lack of body rotation and weight transfer leads to little racquet head speed. Often the player also grips too tight or swings tentatively, afraid to hit out. In essence, they are not generating power from the ground up, so racquet speed stays low. (Late preparation can exacerbate this, as a rushed swing can’t reach high speed in time.)
Beginner Cue: “Swing fast, not hard.” In other words, loosen up your arm and grip. Try to feel the racquet whip through the air. Imagine your arm as a loose rope – by staying relaxed, you can swing faster without muscling the shot. A fun cue is to pretend your racquet is a sword cutting through the air – you want to hear it “whoosh.” Keep the swing smooth and full – don’t worry about hitting long, just feel the speed of the racquet head.
Intermediate Cue: Use your whole body to generate racquet speed. Focus on forward momentum and body rotation: step into the shot and uncoil your hips and shoulders to accelerate the racquet. For example, load your weight on your back foot and then drive to your front foot as you swing, letting your hips turn. A loose grip and smooth acceleration from low-to-high will help – imagine you’re effortlessly throwing the racquet through the ball.
Advanced Cue: Develop a stronger kinetic chain: initiate the swing from the ground up. Drive with your legs and hips, creating a stretch between your hips and shoulders (hip-shoulder separation) before the arm comes through. Feel your core initiating the rotation, and let your arm be the last link (it will naturally whip through faster). Also, ensure you have a relaxed wrist to allow racket lag – the racquet trailing slightly behind then snapping through at contact. This stored energy release adds racquet head speed without extra effort.
Prerequisites: The player should have a consistent contact point and basic stroke technique so that they can swing faster without completely mishitting. A sound grip (for groundstrokes, typically Eastern or Semi-Western on forehands) is important – with a bad grip, they might fear to swing fast. Also, proper warm-up and flexibility help, as generating racquet speed requires the body to be loose and coordinated.
Secondary Effects: Improving racquet speed tends to increase shot power and spin. Balls will travel deeper with the same effort, and topspin will help bring them down into the court. Often, fixing a chronic slow swing also forces better technique (use of legs and trunk), which can improve consistency. Players report that once they relax and accelerate the racquet, their shots feel “effortless” and they gain confidence. In fact, using the body properly can result in more power with less muscle – a more efficient stroke that is easier on the arm.
Common Mistakes When Fixing: The biggest mistake is tensing up and swinging harder with the arm. Many players equate swinging faster with “hitting harder” and end up contracting their muscles – this actually slows the racquet and can ruin control. Remember, a loose arm generates more speed than a stiff arm. Another mistake is losing balance by trying to swing ultra-fast; speed must come from coordination, not just effort. Finally, don’t sacrifice topspin when increasing swing speed – if a player swings faster without brushing up on the ball, they might hit long. The remedy is to maintain its upward swing path for spin even as speed increases.

Inconsistent Contact Point
Symptom Pattern: The player’s contact point is all over the place – sometimes too late (hitting the ball near the body or even behind the front hip), sometimes too early (reaching out and losing power), with varying contact heights. Metrics show high variability in contact distance from the body and height. For example, one shot might be hit at chest height close in, the next at knee height far out front. This inconsistency leads to mishits and erratic ball control.
Root Cause: Inconsistent contact usually stems from poor timing or footwork. Often the player is not preparing or moving into position early enough, so they end up jammed (late contact) or lunging (awkward early contact). It can also be caused by an inconsistent swing rhythm – if each stroke’s timing is different, the contact point will vary. Fundamentally, not tracking the ball well and not adjusting the body with small footwork steps will cause the contact point to wander. Ideally, contact should be at a comfortable, slightly-in-front position each time; when that doesn’t happen, it’s usually because the player didn’t get into position or start the swing on time.
Beginner Cue: “Meet the ball out in front.” As a simple cue, imagine you have to catch the ball with your hand – you’d naturally move so that you catch it in front of your body. Do the same with the racquet. Also, watch the ball closely and keep your head still as you swing; this helps you judge distance. Another beginner tip: move your feet! Don’t wait for the ball to come to you – stay on your toes and adjust your position so the ball is in your ideal hitting zone (around waist height and a bit forward). Tell yourself a phrase like “bounce…and step in” to remind you to move into position as the ball comes.
Intermediate Cue: Emphasize footwork and spacing. Use lots of small adjustment steps to get the right distance from the ball. A good drill is to practice hitting while focusing only on your feet – after every shot, take a few quick recovery steps and prep for the next. Technically, set your body so that the contact point is consistently at roughly waist level and a comfortable distance. You can extend your non-dominant arm out toward the incoming ball as a “measuring stick” – this helps ensure you’re neither too close nor too far. By the time you swing, your front shoulder should be under your chin and the ball just a bit ahead of that front shoulder.
Advanced Cue: Train your contact point discipline. For advanced players, place a target (like a cone or glove) a few feet in front of you and aim to make contact directly above that target for each stroke. This visual cue forces you to adjust your positioning. You can also use drills where you hit through rings or between two cones placed at your ideal contact zone. Another advanced focus: ensure you aren’t fluctuating your swing tempo – keep a consistent backswing and forward swing rhythm so that timing doesn’t yo-yo. Finally, work on reading the ball early (spin, depth, speed) so you can position yourself optimally. The best players use cues like observing the opponent’s racquet face at impact to anticipate where the ball will be, giving them more time to get perfect spacing.
Prerequisites: The player should have a generally sound stroke production (grip, swing path) because if those fundamentals are off, contact point will naturally vary. Also, fitness plays a role – good agility and foot speed help one achieve the desired contact point. If a player’s ready position or split-step is poor, that should be fixed first; you need to be prepared and balanced as the ball comes over the net. Only when a player is in an athletic position can they consistently adjust to find the right contact point.
Secondary Effects: Fixing contact point consistency will immediately improve power and control. Hitting the ball in the ideal spot (usually slightly in front of the body) means you strike the sweet spot more often, which gives you more power and spin on the shot. Consistency in contact also reduces mishits and frame hits, so your reliability goes up. Moreover, a stable contact point can boost confidence – you start to feel you’re hitting each ball cleanly and predictably. This can have a chain reaction: with cleaner contact, you can swing faster when needed, add more spin, and generally play more aggressively knowing the ball will go where you intend.
Common Mistakes When Fixing: A frequent mistake is overcompensating – for example, a player who was late on many balls might start swinging way too early, contacting balls too far in front or without proper weight transfer. (Note that early contact can be just as problematic: hitting too far in front can throw off your balance and disrupt your weight shift into the ball

.) Another mistake is becoming too fixated on contact point and getting tense; some players, in an effort to hit “perfect” contact, stop moving their feet and instead reach with their arm, which actually worsens spacing. Lastly, don’t forget to adjust vertically as well – some players only think in terms of distance from the body and end up taking high balls in awkward positions. When fixing contact, remember it’s a 3D adjustment: distance, height, and timing all together.
Poor Weight Transfer
Symptom Pattern: The player’s weight stays on the back foot or is static through the shot, instead of shifting from back to front. You’ll observe that at contact their back leg might still be loaded with weight (sometimes even the front foot is off the ground or just lightly touching). The Weight transfer metric might read “static” or even backward. Visually, the player might lean away or upward rather than into the court. For example, on a neutral forehand, their weight remains on the right foot (for a right-hander) instead of driving forward onto the left foot.
Root Cause: Often a lack of forward momentum in the stroke. The player might be using too open a stance or simply not stepping in when they have time, resulting in a more arm-dominated, arm-only swing. In some cases, it’s due to hitting off the back foot habitually – sometimes a result of being late or misjudging the ball, other times a technical habit. Additionally, an overly closed stance can freeze weight transfer (if the front foot is planted too far across, the body can’t move forward easily). In essence, the player is not utilizing the legs and gravity to move through the shot – they remain anchored or falling backward, so energy isn’t going into the ball.
Beginner Cue: “Step into the ball.” A simple but powerful cue: as you swing, take a step forward with your lead foot (for a right-hander’s forehand, that’s the left foot). Feel your weight move from your back leg to your front leg. Imagine you are throwing a punch or throwing a ball – your body would naturally move forward. In tennis, do the same: hit and step. Another cue: pretend there’s a line just in front of you – try to get your bellybutton over that line by the end of the swing (this ensures you’ve shifted forward).
Intermediate Cue: Use the ground and your legs. Start in a slightly loaded stance (bend your knees) and push through the ground as you swing, so that your momentum goes forward. If you often use open stance, practice a neutral stance drill: for example, drop-feed yourself some balls and consciously plant your front foot and swing, finishing with your back foot sliding up or even lifting off (a sign that weight went forward). Coach Patrick Mouratoglou often tells players: “Step in and rotate” – meaning step forward with your weight and turn your body through the shot

. You can also imagine kicking a soccer ball with your back foot after contact – this mental trick encourages that foot to come forward, showing that weight has transferred.
Advanced Cue: Think of weight transfer as the natural result of proper technique. Instead of actively “throwing” your weight, focus on uncoiling from the hips and legs – if you do that, the weight will shift automatically. In advanced terms: drive your rear hip toward the ball as you initiate the forward swing. This hip drive, along with a strong push off the back leg, will cause your weight to flow forward into the shot. In fact, high-level coaches note that “weight transfer is a result, not a cause” – if you use your legs and core (pelvic rotation, ground push-off), the weight will transfer on its own

. Practically, you can check yourself by your finish: an advanced hitter will often finish with their back foot lifted or just the toe down, because almost all weight has moved to the front foot. If you can freeze at your finish and comfortably lift your back foot, you know you transferred well.
Prerequisites: First, the player needs a decent sense of balance. If they struggle to maintain balance while moving, that must be addressed (through agility drills, etc.), otherwise stepping in might throw them off-balance. A good split-step and readiness is needed to allow moving forward – if you’re late, you can’t transfer weight properly. Also, understanding stance usage is important: the player should know how to execute neutral, semi-open, and open stances. Weight transfer is most obvious in neutral stance (stepping straight forward); in open stance it still happens, but more subtly (weight goes from right leg to left leg for a right-hander, even if feet don’t change places). So the player should be taught that even in an open stance, the body can and should shift toward the target somewhat. Finally, a proper grip and swing that produce topspin will give the player confidence to step in (if a player has an extreme grip or flat swing, they may hang back to lift the ball – fix the stroke mechanics alongside weight transfer).
Secondary Effects: Proper weight transfer will immediately add power to shots without extra swing effort – you’re effectively getting free power from your body weight. You’ll also notice improved consistency; when weight goes into the ball, you’re less likely to fall backward or hit off your back foot, which can cause errors. Another benefit: it relieves stress on your arm and shoulder. By using your legs and core to drive the shot, the arm doesn’t have to work as hard (many chronic tennis elbow cases are aggravated by players arming the ball with no weight transfer). Additionally, your shots will have more “heaviness” – that combination of pace and spin – because the body is fully behind the ball. Lastly, good weight transfer often leads to better recovery for the next shot: if you move through the ball, you’re naturally coming inside the court and can push off to recover, rather than being stuck on the back foot.
Common Mistakes When Fixing: A common mistake is stepping in at the wrong time. For instance, trying to force a step forward on a wide running shot – this can throw you off so badly that all your momentum goes sideways and you completely miss the target

. The fix is to know when NOT to step straight in (sometimes an open stance or a lateral hop is better on the run). Another mistake is over-committing forward: some players lunge into the ball, only to be passed or to lose balance. Weight transfer should be controlled – think of it as gliding through the shot, not leaping. Also, beware of simply leaning forward with your upper body instead of moving your weight – bending at the waist isn’t true weight transfer and can mess up your swing plane. The transfer should come from your hips moving forward, not from just your head and shoulders lunging. Finally, when players hear “use your legs,” sometimes they only bend their knees in place (which is good for stability but not the same as moving weight). Don’t just squat – make sure that bend leads into a push forward, not just up and down in the same spot.
Insufficient Rotation
Symptom Pattern: The player’s body rotation is limited – at contact, their shoulders and hips are still mostly facing the net (or only slightly turned). The Body rotation metric might show a small degree (say < 30° of shoulder turn relative to the baseline at contact). Hip-shoulder separation is minimal; the player is essentially swinging with just the arm, rather than coiling and uncoiling the torso. This often results in a flimsier shot (since there’s no torso power) and can be seen as a very short follow-through (the arm doesn’t wrap around fully because the body never rotated). For example, on a forehand, instead of the front shoulder coming around naturally, the player’s chest might already be facing forward almost the whole time – a sign of poor unit turn.
Root Cause: The player is failing to coil their body in the preparation, meaning they have little stored energy to unleash. This could be due to habit (they may have been taught to keep their body facing forward, or they just haven’t learned to turn). An overly closed stance can also limit rotation – the front leg blocks the turn, making the swing mostly arm-driven

. In other cases, the player rotates initially but stops rotating too early, not completing the motion (sometimes out of fear of hitting out, they might freeze their body). Essentially, the kinetic chain is broken – the legs and hips might start to rotate, but the upper body doesn’t follow through, or everything rotates in unison without that stored twist. The result is a lack of torso contribution and loss of power.
Beginner Cue: “Turn your shoulders!” This cue cannot be over-emphasized. The moment you see where the incoming ball is going, rotate your shoulders and hips sideways. Legendary coach Nick Bollettieri would shout, “Turn those hips and shoulders!”

 because a full unit turn is the foundation of a good stroke. For a beginner, a helpful image is to show your back to your opponent (on a forehand groundstroke for example, your back should almost face the net as you take the racquet back). Another simple cue: pretend there’s a pole running through the top of your head down your spine – now twist around that pole on the backswing, like winding up a spring. Feel your torso coil. Even if it feels exaggerated, it’s likely just right.
Intermediate Cue: Focus on the sequence of your rotation. The hips should initiate, then the shoulders follow – this creates a stretch (separation) that unleashes power. If you rotate everything together, you’re not getting that elastic benefit. A technical cue: lead with your hip. For instance, on the forehand, let your front hip start to uncoil a split-second before your shoulders – this will pull your torso into rotation. If you tend to arm the ball, practice hitting while consciously driving your right hip (for a right-hander) toward the net, forcing the shoulder to come around. Also, use your non-dominant arm as a trigger: on the forehand, once you’ve turned sideways with your left arm pointing out, pull that left arm back (like you’re elbowing someone behind you) – this action will cause your left shoulder to move back and your right shoulder to rotate forward into the shot. It’s a classic cue to help complete your shoulder turn. Finally, ensure that you are not holding your breath or staying rigid – exhale and rotate through the hit. Fluid rotation combined with proper timing will vastly increase your racquet speed

.
Advanced Cue: Refine the hip-shoulder separation. Advanced players will work on increasing the torque: when you coil, try to turn your shoulders significantly more than your hips. For example, you might turn your shoulders ~90° while your hips turn ~45° during the backswing – this stores energy in your core. Then, fire the hips to initiate the forward swing and let the shoulders catch up and even overtake (the classic stretch-shortening cycle). Another advanced focus is keeping a stable head while rotating – don’t let your head rotate with your shoulders

. This is key for maintaining balance and tracking the ball. Your body can rotate independently of your head/eyes. A drill: stand in front of a mirror, turn your shoulders as if taking a backswing while trying to keep your face looking forward (eyes would stay on the “ball”). Pros can rotate their torso a lot while the head barely moves – strive for that flexibility

. Finally, work on a full finish: for a right-hander’s forehand, your chest should end up facing nearly the sideline or back fence on the right – this proves you didn’t cut the rotation short. On a two-handed backhand, your chest should finish facing the opposite sideline. These full rotations ensure you utilized your core fully.
Prerequisites: The player should have adequate core strength and flexibility to execute a good rotation – tight lower back or core muscles can impede a full turn, so some off-court stretching or conditioning might be needed. Footwork must support rotation: if your foot positioning is off (for example, always in a narrow stance), you might literally be unable to rotate fully without losing balance. So, a solid stance and good spacing to the ball are needed (if you’re jammed, you can’t rotate). Moreover, the player should be comfortable with the concept of the unit turn (turning shoulders and hips together) as a fundamental – if not, that concept needs to be taught. Sometimes grip issues can limit rotation (e.g., a very extreme grip might cause a player to open up early); ensure the grip is within a reasonable range. Lastly, confidence in timing is important: players who mistrust their timing often avoid full rotation (subconsciously fearing they won’t get back around in time). Thus, some timing drills might go hand-in-hand with rotation drills.
Secondary Effects: Fixing rotation yields significant power gains. By involving the large muscle groups of the core, the player can generate more racquet speed and depth without extra arm effort. Additionally, improved rotation often leads to better consistency and injury prevention. When you rotate properly, you spread the load of the stroke across your whole body instead of just the arm, reducing strain on the shoulder and elbow. Another side effect: better rotation can improve timing. It might sound counterintuitive, but when you prepare by coiling early, you actually give yourself more time to swing in a relaxed way, thus timing the ball better. Rotation also helps with spin production – as you uncoil, you can impart more topspin due to the greater speed and upward drive of the shoulder. Players who add a good shoulder turn frequently report their shots “heavy” (fast and spinning) and their control improves because they’re not swiping with just an arm; the stroke becomes repeatable. And don’t overlook psychological effects: a fully rotated stroke feels powerful, which can boost a player’s confidence and aggressiveness in matches.
Common Mistakes When Fixing: The classic error is over-rotation or rotating at the wrong time. For example, a player trying to rotate more might spin their shoulders too early, before contact, pulling their chest away from the ball. This often results in shanked or off-center hits and balls spraying wide because the body opened up prematurely

. The fix is to rotate fully but not until you’re actually swinging through contact – in other words, coil early, then uncoil on time. Another mistake: turning the head with the shoulders. Some players, in an effort to rotate, will also pull their head off the ball (looking toward where they intend to hit) – this leads to loss of focus on the ball and balance issues

. Keep your eyes on the contact point even as your torso turns. Also, be wary of stepping back during the unit turn. Occasionally, players will misunderstand rotation and actually step away from the ball (toward the back fence) as they coil, which shifts weight backwards and “robs you of power and time”

. The correct move is to pivot in place or even step into the court if possible, not away. Lastly, don’t force an unnatural range of motion – some players hear “more rotation” and try to wrench their torso beyond their flexibility, leading to awkward strokes or even back pain. Increase your turn gradually as your flexibility improves, and always pair rotation with good fundamentals (like knee bend and balance) so it’s a controlled power, not just a spin-out.
Collapsing Elbow (Chicken Wing)
Symptom Pattern: The hitting elbow is excessively bent at contact, often tucked close to the body – colloquially known as a “chicken wing.” For instance, on a right-hander’s forehand, instead of a comfortable extension, the elbow might be at a sharp angle (<120°) and the racquet is almost in against the player’s torso at impact. You might observe the player hitting many shots with a bent arm, robbing them of reach and power. This is reflected in metrics like Elbow angle at contact being very small. The contact point tends to be too close to the body, indicating the player is not creating enough space for a full extension.
Root Cause: The “collapsing elbow” often results from lack of spacing or late contact – the player is not far enough from the ball, so the arm has nowhere to go but to bend and “chicken wing” to make contact. Another cause is fear of overhitting: some players subconsciously keep their arm in to exert control, essentially shortening the lever to make the shot feel safer. It’s noted that “chicken-wing is often a result of forehand insecurity and the desire to avoid overhitting”

. By keeping the elbow in, they also lock their wrist/forearm to avoid opening the racquet face. This might feel safer, but it drastically limits power and spin. In some cases, a player was taught to hit with a bent elbow (for control), but has taken it too far, never learning to extend through the ball. All in all, the root issue is improper contact point and an overly constrained swing.
Beginner Cue: “Imagine shaking hands with the ball out in front.” This encourages reaching forward. Tell the player to reach out as if to shake hands or “high-five” the ball with their racquet. This mental image promotes a more extended arm at contact instead of a tucked elbow. Another cue: keep some space between your elbow and your body – you can literally stick a tennis ball in your armpit and practice mini-swings where you don’t drop it (the ball will drop if you chicken wing too much). For beginners, also emphasize moving the feet: often the elbow collapses because they’re too close to the ball. So, “Don’t crowd it – move your feet to give your arm room.”
Intermediate Cue: Focus on spacing and extension. A technical tip: maintain roughly a fist’s distance (about 4-6 inches) between your elbow and your torso as you swing

. One way to achieve this is by using the non-dominant arm – on forehands, after you unit turn, your left arm can act as a “separator.” Keep your left arm out front longer and only tuck it in once you’re swinging; this prevents you from collapsing too soon. Also, practice hitting out in front: set up a cone well in front of your front foot and try to hit balls so that you’d contact above that cone. Technically, think of extending through contact – the idea is to have your hitting arm comfortably extended (not locked straight, but with a natural slight bend) at the moment of impact. You might use a cue like “Extend and finish” – hit through the ball as if you want your racquet to continue traveling out toward the target for a foot or two after contact. This combats the tendency to pull the arm in.
Advanced Cue: Work on the straight-arm forehand (if appropriate for the player). Many elite players (Federer, Nadal, etc.) use a straight or nearly straight arm at contact for maximal leverage

. While not everyone needs a fully straight arm, exploring a longer lever can help an advanced player who’s been too cramped. Start by incremental changes: if you normally have a big bend, try to reduce that bend over time. Advanced drills: hit against a wall or ball machine focusing on keeping your hitting arm structure the same through contact and into the follow-through (the elbow shouldn’t chicken-wing at contact or immediately after). Also, analyze why you bend – if it’s a late timing issue, work on timing; if it’s habit, use slow, deliberate shadow swings with a straighter arm. Key: Don’t sacrifice relaxation – an advanced player should still have a loose arm. The goal is a free swing with full extension. Monitor for overcorrection: a fully locked straight arm with tension is not good (can cause injury and timing issues

). Instead, strive for a “naturally straight” arm – smooth and extended. If two-handed backhand elbow is collapsing (common in one-hand slice or volleys too), similar principles apply: increase your reach to the ball and drive through it without tucking in.
Prerequisites: The player must have decent timing and footwork; without those, telling them to “extend” could lead to reaching for balls they’re late on (which might actually worsen mishits). So, ensure the player is getting into position early enough to allow extension. A solid understanding of grip and stroke path is also needed – for instance, if their grip is too extreme and they fear framing the ball, they might revert to chicken-winging to compensate. Also, the player’s shoulder and arm flexibility/health matter: some individuals feel strain when trying to fully straighten the arm. In such cases, work on strength and flexibility of the shoulder so they can support a longer lever without pain. Lastly, confidence is a prerequisite – the player must trust that extending the arm won’t make the ball fly out; usually this trust comes from knowing how to generate topspin, which brings the ball down. So a prerequisite to fixing the elbow may be ensuring the player has a swing path that imparts spin (so they can swing full and extend).
Secondary Effects: Eliminating the chicken wing leads to cleaner, more powerful hits. By extending the arm more, the player engages the full racket swing radius, which means higher racket speed at contact (a longer lever travels faster for a given rotation)

. This translates into easier power and often more spin as well, since the racquet can accelerate through the ball on a longer path. Also, better spacing (which comes with fixing a collapsing elbow) improves consistency – the player will contact in front of their body where they have leverage, rather than late and jammed where mishits occur

. Another benefit is reduced stress on the elbow and wrist. Counterintuitively, keeping the elbow too bent can cause strain, because the player might flick the wrist or arm to compensate; with a fuller extension, the large muscles do the work and the ball impact is absorbed along the extended arm (as long as it’s not hyper-extended). Some players also find that fixing this issue gives them more reach on wide balls – they’re able to hit effectively out to the side because they’re no longer keeping the arm cramped in. Overall, the stroke feels more fluid and “free” once the elbow isn’t locking them in.
Common Mistakes When Fixing: One mistake is over-straightening the arm and becoming too rigid. A player hears “don’t bend your elbow” and then locks their elbow completely straight through the whole swing – this can be harmful and reduce spin (the straight-arm technique still requires relaxation and usually is something advanced players use with excellent timing)

. Overdoing it might also cause the player to frame the ball more if their timing isn’t ready for a more extended contact – suddenly reaching further in front without adjusting swing timing can lead to hitting off the tip of the racquet. Another mistake is forgetting the role of the body – sometimes players focus so much on their arm that they neglect shoulder turn or weight transfer, and they end up reaching with the arm alone. This results in weak, arm-y shots (now with a straight arm but no power from legs/torso). It’s important to fix the spacing with footwork, not just by lunging with the arm. Lastly, patience is key: if someone has hit with a bent elbow for years, changing it will feel weird and shots might initially suffer. A common error is abandoning the fix too soon (“oh, I tried to extend and hit a few balls long, so I went back to my old ways”). It’s crucial to stick with the adjustment through practice so that it becomes comfortable and the true benefits (better power/control) emerge once timing is recalibrated.
Closed Stance Limiting Power
Symptom Pattern: The player habitually uses a closed stance (front foot stepped across the body) on shots where an open or neutral stance might be more appropriate. This often results in limited hip rotation and a feeling of being “locked up.” For example, on the forehand, a right-hander might always plant their left foot far to the right of their body (closed off), with their chest facing the side fence at contact. The Stance type metric frequently reads “closed” even when hitting easy rally balls. Consequently, their shots lack power and sometimes finish with the player off-balance (because a closed stance can make recovery harder). You may also see the player’s follow-through cut short or wrap awkwardly, a sign that their front leg blocked the turn.
Root Cause: Overemphasis on stepping into the ball, often taught in older coaching methods, can lead to a persistently closed stance. While stepping in is not bad, doing it in all situations is. A too-closed stance “closes off” the body and restricts the amount of upper body rotation possible, resulting in a more linear (less powerful) shot

. Essentially, the player’s front leg acts like a door stop on their hip turn – once that front foot is planted across, the hips can’t fully rotate. This limits the contribution of the core and legs. Additionally, in a closed stance the momentum goes forward but not necessarily into rotation, so if the timing or ball height isn’t ideal, the player can’t adjust mid-swing. The root cause is often misunderstanding stance usage: the player might think closed stance always yields more power (“step in no matter what”) when in reality it’s situational.
Beginner Cue: “Open up your stance a bit.” Encourage the player to set their feet more parallel to the baseline when time allows. For a right-hander’s forehand, instead of stepping the left foot far right across the body, have them step so that the feet are more like shoulder-width apart and facing 45° to the net. A simple cue: “Point your front foot at the net post.” This ensures they aren’t completely sideways. They should also try hitting some balls from a semi-open stance (feet diagonal to the net) to get comfortable. Often I’ll draw a line or place markers for where the feet should go for neutral vs open stances and have the player hit from those positions. Telling a beginner, “you don’t always have to step forward; you can also push off your outside leg,” introduces the concept that planting the outside foot and rotating (open stance) is okay.
Intermediate Cue: Emphasize using the appropriate stance for the situation. Teach the player the advantages: closed/neutral stance helps when you have time to step in and want to drive through the ball, whereas open stance helps when you need to rotate quickly or deal with fast, wide balls


. Have them practice forehands where they deliberately use an open stance on some (especially on wider or faster feeds) – loading on the outside leg and allowing the hips to rotate freely into the shot. A technical focus: unlock the hips. If a player is too closed, I tell them, “imagine your hips are on a swivel – they need to swivel toward the net as you swing.” That can’t happen if the stance is excessively closed. So, drill it: from a semi-open stance, have them swing and focus on turning their bellybutton to face the net at finish (guaranteeing they used rotation). Another cue: “Inside foot to outside foot” – meaning if you’re right-handed, start with weight on your right (back) foot and finish on your left (front) foot with a pivot, not a stuck front foot. This gets them used to weight transfer plus hip rotation.
Advanced Cue: The advanced player should cultivate the ability to blend stances and not be trapped in one style. Work on transition stances like a semi-open with a step-through: for instance, on a slower short ball, you might step in with a neutral stance then let your back leg kick around, effectively merging rotation with forward weight transfer (often called a “walking step” finish). This yields power and recovery. Also, practice open-stance acceleration: load on the outside leg heavily and explode, rotating shoulders and hips fully. An advanced player can generate as much or more power with an open stance by using the core – in fact, open stance allows for more upper-body rotation, which gives extra racket speed

. It’s just a matter of timing and strength. Another advanced focus: recognizing when closed stance hurts you. For example, if you’re consistently late on deep balls because you insist on stepping in, train yourself to hit those off your back foot with an open stance and good torso rotation. Use video to self-analyze: if you see your front leg acting as a brake (your hip rotation stopping early), experiment with a slightly less closed position next time. Essentially, advanced players should be stance-fluid – able to hit with closed, neutral, semi-open, or open as needed, all while maintaining balance and power.
Prerequisites: The player should already have the basic footwork patterns (unit turn, weight transfer) down. If a player doesn’t know how to do an open-stance shot at all, you’d first drill that in isolation. Good leg strength and footwork are needed to execute open stance or to step in correctly without losing speed. Also, the player’s hitting zone and swing path should be adaptable – e.g., they should be capable of producing topspin in various stances; if not, work on that because topspin can help control the extra rotation in open stance. A solid understanding of when to use each stance is also a prerequisite knowledge: for instance, knowing that high balls or wide balls often demand open stance, while short balls invite stepping in. If the player’s mind is stuck (“I must always step forward”), start by educating them on rally examples from pros, etc. (They must accept the idea of different stances before they can execute it.) Finally, ensure their balance is sufficient – being able to hit open stance requires good balance on the outside leg, and hitting closed stance requires good alignment; without general balance, any stance change will be shaky.
Secondary Effects: Correcting stance usage can unlock significant power and spin. By not forcing a closed stance all the time, the player can rotate more freely, leading to higher racquet head speed and heavier shots


. Also, their consistency might improve on certain shots – for instance, on high or deep balls, using an open stance can prevent late, off-balance hits, thus reducing errors. Another benefit: improved recovery and court positioning. An overly closed stance often made the player end up with feet crossed and weight going forward, making it slow to push back for the next ball. Once they incorporate open/semi-open stances, they can hit and recover more efficiently (since the momentum can stay more centered or allow a quick push-off). This particularly shows when dealing with heavy topspin or fast drives – an open stance absorption and re-hit can be done without getting knocked off balance. Additionally, varying the stance gives the player more tactical options (like hitting heavy topspin from an open stance when pushed back, versus flattening out from a closed stance when stepping in). Overall, power grows and the player feels less “restricted” in their stroke. They often report that their strokes feel more natural and flowing when they’re not forcing a stance that doesn’t fit the ball.
Common Mistakes When Fixing: One common pitfall is overdoing the switch – a player hears “don’t close off so much” and then tries to hit every ball open stance, even those where they should step in. This can cause its own problems: for example, hitting an easy sitter with open stance might cause them to over-rotate and pull off the shot, losing control and sending it wide or short

. The key is moderation: use open stance when needed, but still step in on sitters or short balls where you can drive through. Another mistake is poor weight transfer in the new stance: some players, when attempting more open stances, forget to shift weight at all and end up arm-swinging with weight stuck back. Even in an open stance, you usually transfer weight from your outside leg to your inside leg (to some extent) – don’t neglect that. Also, when changing stance, don’t neglect the contact point – players might suddenly mis-time things because the geometry of their swing changed. Give yourself time to adjust your timing when you adopt a different stance. Lastly, avoid getting confused or indecisive about stance in the middle of a shot – commit to one. A common error is starting to step in (closed) then at last second trying to go open (or vice versa), resulting in a weird half-stance with no rotation or balance. Decide early based on the incoming ball and execute that stance fully. With practice, this becomes instinctual.
Late Preparation
Symptom Pattern: The player consistently initiates their backswing too late. You’ll notice their racquet often isn’t in position (set back) by the time the ball is bouncing on their side. Preparation time metric will be high – e.g., they might only complete their unit turn a split second before contact (Preparation time > 1.0s is a red flag, or specifically Preparation time > 1.2s paired with low swing speed). A concrete pattern: Velocity < 0.035 AND Preparation time > 1.2s, which indicates a very slow racquet speed likely caused by a delayed backswing. Visually, the player looks rushed – often hitting off the back foot, with a short or panicky swing, and frequently contacting late. They might even resort to just blocking the ball back because there’s no time to swing fluidly.
Root Cause: The player is reacting rather than anticipating. This often comes from not watching the opponent’s cues or simply the habit of waiting to initiate the swing until the ball is almost on them. A major cause is insufficient unit turn (shoulder turn) done early – if they don’t do that initial turn as soon as possible, everything else is delayed. Nick Bollettieri always preached that you “cannot prepare soon enough”, i.e., turn your hips and shoulders immediately

. When that doesn’t happen, preparation lags. Other contributing factors: a poor ready position (if a player has an improper grip or stance and has to adjust too much as the ball comes, they lose precious time), lack of split-step (starting late because they’re literally late to react), and even mental focus (some players just don’t pick up the incoming ball early, so they start late). Essentially, late preparation is a timing/anticipation issue – the “engine” of the stroke (the turn and backswing) starts too late in the ball’s flight.
Beginner Cue: “Turn your shoulders as soon as you see the ball coming.” This cue should be automatic: the instant you perceive the ball leaving your opponent’s racquet, rotate into your unit turn. Even say to yourself, “turn!” as a keyword. Another simple cue: “Prep by bounce.” Try to have your backswing (racquet back) done by the time the ball bounces on your side. For a beginner, that might mean consciously starting the swing much earlier than feels necessary. Also, ensure the beginner has their racquet up and ready in the neutral position when awaiting the ball – from ready position, the first move is a shoulder turn, not a big backswing with the arm. Emphasize using the opposite hand: on a forehand, the left hand takes the racquet back initially (this forces the shoulders to turn). This kind of early unit turn is crucial. A famous tip is, “If in doubt, prepare earlier.” You basically cannot turn too early. Even if you turn early and have to wait a split second, that’s fine – it’s far better than turning late and rushing


.
Intermediate Cue: “Complete your shoulder turn before the ball bounces.” In practical terms, when the ball is about halfway to you, your racket should already be back and your body coiled. An intermediate player can practice a rhythm: as the opponent hits, you do your unit turn; as the ball is in the air, you’re set; when it bounces, you begin the forward swing. In fact, a common coaching phrase is, “Backswing when you see their racquet swing.” The moment you see your opponent swing at the ball, you initiate your turn – this links your timing to an external cue. Technically, work on a smooth unit turn (hips and shoulders together) and pause in the backswing if needed – it’s okay to be waiting with racquet back for a moment. A drill: have someone drop feed balls or use a ball machine and call out “turn” well before the ball arrives, getting you in the habit of that early prep. Also, improve your split-step timing: you should split as your opponent makes contact, and immediately on landing from the split, you’re turning. Think of it as split-step then instantly unit turn. By the time the ball is traveling toward you, you’re already in position to swing

. This might feel early, but intermediate players often remark how unrushed everything becomes when they prepare early.
Advanced Cue: Develop anticipation and efficiency. Advanced players should work on reading opponents so they can start preparing even before the ball crosses the net (for instance, recognizing a likely cross-court vs down-the-line shot from opponent’s body position). Also, focus on the concept of “tempo” – your preparation has a rhythm that matches the ball’s flight. A high-level cue: initiate your core rotation (unit turn) even as you’re moving to the ball. That means you’re not waiting to set your feet to start the swing; you turn while you move, which is a hallmark of advanced footwork. Use your left hand (for right-handers) as a trigger for early turn – keep it on the racquet longer during the take-back; this ensures the torso turns fully early on. Another cue: “Bounce-hit.” Say “bounce” when the ball bounces and “hit” when you strike it – this classic drill can sharpen your timing and ensure you’re not late. If you find you’re saying “hit” after you actually made contact, you know you’re late! Finally, trust a compact swing at higher levels. Advanced players don’t need huge backswings because they generate pace with rotation and racquet speed. By keeping the backswing efficient, you reduce the time needed to prepare, effectively “buying” extra milliseconds for yourself. In summary, at advanced play: read early, turn early, and keep your swing efficient so you’re always ready to fire as the ball enters your strike zone

.
Prerequisites: A consistent ready position and grip are absolute musts. If the player is still changing grips between shots or has an inconsistent ready stance, late prep will persist. For example, if you hit a forehand with one grip and a backhand with another and you only change that grip after the ball bounces, you’ll always be late. So a prerequisite is having your grip sorted out (or using a universal grip to some extent, or at least changing immediately after the previous shot). A good split-step habit is also a prerequisite – without that athletic readiness, you’re starting from behind. Physically, good dynamic balance is needed: you should be able to turn your shoulders without stumbling or losing speed as you move. If not, some agility training might be warranted. Also, knowledge of stroke technique is needed so that when you do prepare early, you know how to hold that coil briefly; some beginners who prepare early then lose the coil because they aren’t used to waiting – an intermediate/advanced player should have the control to stay in the loaded position. Finally, mental alertness: you have to want to watch the opponent’s contact and react instantly. Training one’s concentration (every point, ready position, watch opponent) is a precursor to fixing late prep.
Secondary Effects: Solving late preparation often yields dramatic overall improvement. Immediately, you’ll see an increase in racquet speed and shot quality because the player now has time to execute a full, relaxed swing instead of a rushed poke

. Consistency will improve as well – many “unforced” errors disappear when you’re not rushing. Early prep means better contact point too; the player can hit the ball in the ideal position since they’re not lunging last-second. It also opens up the court vision and tactics for the player; when you’re prepared early, you can actually choose your placement and think ahead (rather than scrambling just to make the shot). Another effect: the player’s confidence grows, because the game suddenly feels slower or more under control. Often fixing this issue has a cascading benefit: because you’re prepared, you can transfer weight, rotate, follow through – essentially a lot of other technical aspects (like weight transfer, balance, follow-through) fall into place when you’re on time. Indeed, early preparation “helps you strike the ball with some authority,” as Bollettieri noted

, which in turn can add pace and depth to your strokes automatically.
Common Mistakes When Fixing: A common mistake is over-rotation or being too tense too soon. Occasionally a player will interpret “prepare early” as “twist your whole body and coil like crazy way in advance,” leading them to turn excessively and even step away from the ball (for example, stepping back with the back foot) which can mess up their positioning

. Early prep should not break your footwork; you still have to move to the ball. Don’t become a statue with a full backswing waiting flat-footed – continue to adjust with your legs. Another mistake: freezing the backswing awkwardly. While it’s good to be prepared with time to spare, some players will take the racquet back early and then stop all movement, losing rhythm. The preparation should flow into the swing – if you do pause, it’s a poised, dynamic pause (like a coiled spring, not a rigid hold). Overcoming late prep is about timing, so maintain a good rhythm. Additionally, when focusing on early prep, some players forget to track the ball at the end – they turn early but then don’t make small last-second adjustments because they assumed the early turn alone was enough. You still must move your feet to get ideal spacing even if you turned early. Lastly, patience: if you’ve been late for a long time, training yourself to react earlier might at first mess with your timing (you might swing too soon on a few balls). That’s okay – it’s better to be a little early than consistently late. Avoid the mistake of abandoning the change because of a few mistimed swings. With repetition, your brain will adjust the timing. The old saying, “You can never be too early, but you can definitely be too late,” holds here – stick with the early prep and soon nothing will feel “too early” at all, it will just feel normal and balanced.
Poor Follow-Through
Symptom Pattern: The player consistently abbreviates their follow-through. After contact, the swing seems to stop or decelerate rapidly. Instead of the racquet finishing high or around the body, it might end low or the player might “poke” at the ball and then drop the racquet. You’ll see things like the swing path smoothness metric being low (indicating a jerky, not continuous, swing). In many cases the finish position is telling: for example, on a forehand, instead of the racquet wrapping over the opposite shoulder, the player might end with the racquet in front of their chest or not much past the contact point. This often coincides with the player’s weight staying back or their body not rotating fully, and it results in shots that lack depth and spin. They might net a lot of balls (due to deceleration) or just hit with no “heaviness.” Coaches watching would immediately say, “They’re not finishing the stroke.”
Root Cause: Fear of hitting long or lack of intent to drive through the ball is a common cause. The player might consciously or subconsciously be trying to “control” the shot by slowing down at contact, thinking that will make it more accurate. Unfortunately, this often causes the opposite effect (balls die into the net or fly unpredictably). Another cause can be inadequate coaching or understanding – the player was never taught how important the follow-through is, so they developed a habit of stopping the racquet after contact. Additionally, if a player is very tense or holding the racquet too tightly, they might physically inhibit the continuation of the swing. In some cases, late preparation or other issues contribute – if you’re rushing, you might have to cut the follow-through short because the stroke never fully formed. But assuming preparation is okay, the root problem is the player is not accelerating through contact and not allowing the racquet to naturally continue its path. They might think the job is done at contact and consciously or unconsciously “put on the brakes.”
Beginner Cue: “Finish the swing – pretend you want to scratch your back with your racquet.” This is a common way to encourage a full follow-through on the forehand: wrap the racquet around your body so it nearly touches your back (for a righty forehand, the racquet comes around over the left shoulder). Nick Bollettieri used to say, “Wrap that racquet around the opposite shoulder at the end, baby!”
courts.club
 – channel that feeling. Another cue: “Swing through five balls, not one.” Imagine the ball isn’t just one, but there are multiple balls in a row – you have to swing through where each of them would be. This forces you to extend and not stop at the first ball. For beginners, I often physically have them pose the finish: for forehand, racquet over the shoulder, elbow pointing forward; for backhand, racquet over the opposite shoulder, etc. We say, “show me your finish!” and hold it. If they end the swing correctly, they should be in a nice balanced pose. Reward that feeling of a complete finish.
Intermediate Cue: Focus on accelerating through contact and following through high. A good technical reminder: “Racquet to the shoulder.” For a forehand, your racquet head should finish by your left shoulder (and vice versa for a two-handed backhand). One specific cue: “Elbow to the sky (or net) on the follow-through.” For example, on a modern forehand, as you finish, your hitting elbow often points toward the net or upward, indicating you carried your swing through

. If you stop short, your elbow will remain low or pointing down. Also, emphasize that the swing doesn’t end at impact – impact is just the middle. An intermediate player can grasp that the follow-through is crucial for spin and control. Remind them: a full follow-through actually gives more control, because it ensures they didn’t decelerate (deceleration causes inconsistencies). Drills: have them hit and hold the finish for 2 seconds – this builds the habit of completing the stroke. They can also practice throwing a medicine ball or frisbee: you must release and continue your motion; if you stopped your arm on a throw, you’d drop the object behind you. The same concept in tennis – “release” the racquet and let it go.
Advanced Cue: For an advanced player, sometimes it’s about refining the follow-through path rather than simply completing it. Work on the concept of hitting through the ball along the intended target line before wrapping around. For instance, on a forehand, feel as if the racquet extends out towards the target a bit longer and then naturally comes around over the shoulder. Advanced cue: “Extend, then wrap.” This prevents an overly loopy follow-through that’s all spin and no penetration. Another advanced thought: use the non-dominant arm for balance on the finish – e.g., after a forehand, your left arm should naturally swing back (counterbalance) as your right arm comes around; this indicates a full, relaxed follow-through and good body rotation. If that left arm is clamped or flailing, something’s off in the follow-through or rotation. Also, consider the concept of “heavy” ball which requires a full finish – to hit heavy (pace + spin), you must accelerate through and finish high; advanced players can visualize ripping up and across the ball and finishing with the racquet butt almost pointing at the opponent. One more: “Soft hands, fast finish.” Loosen the grip slightly as you approach contact and let the racquet fly through – you’ll notice a whippy, complete finish when you do this correctly (and plenty of spin). Essentially, at advanced levels, the follow-through might adapt (buggy-whip forehands, windshield-wiper finishes, etc.), but even those are complete motions – the racquet still accelerates and wraps around; it’s just a different plane. So the advanced focus is on ensuring no matter what variation of finish, it’s never truncated or forced—it’s the natural result of your swing’s momentum.
Prerequisites: The player should have a reliable swing path and grip that allows a follow-through. For instance, if someone has an extreme grip but hasn’t learned to swing fully, they might fear the follow-through (thinking the ball will launch). So having basic topspin generation skills helps – topspin is your safety net that allows a full finish. A proper unit turn and stroke biomechanics are also needed; if the stroke is fundamentally wrong (say, chopping down on the ball), of course they won’t follow through upward. So those fundamentals might need addressing. Additionally, ensure that any injury concerns are addressed – occasionally a player doesn’t follow through due to shoulder pain or similar; if so, strengthen and rehab so they can trust a full motion. A good understanding that tennis strokes are not like “punches” but more like “swings” is a mental prerequisite – if someone conceptually thinks they should punch the ball, they’ll tend to stop the racquet. We need them to understand it’s a swing and a brush. Lastly, the player must be hitting with appropriate speed for their level – sometimes players who are very tentative don’t follow through simply because they are trying to hit too softly. Odd as it sounds, to fix the follow-through, they must be willing to hit with a bit more gusto (not necessarily flat or hard, but committing to the shot). So convincing them to hit through the ball is part of the mental prerequisites.
Secondary Effects: Improving the follow-through usually brings an immediate boost in power and topspin. By not cutting off the swing, the player’s racquet accelerates through contact, driving the ball with more pace and spin. One can expect deeper shots with more shape (arc) that land in with topspin, as opposed to weak floaters. Interestingly, consistency often improves too when players commit to a full follow-through

. It might feel like swinging more would be riskier, but because the stroke is continuous, there’s less chance for last-moment tweaks that send the ball off course. Also, a full follow-through contributes to better weight transfer and rotation, since stopping the swing can also stall your body rotation. So players find their whole stroke falls into place – they naturally turn their shoulders more and step in more when they know they’re going to swing freely to finish. Another effect is on the mental game: swinging through the ball is a form of aggression and confidence. Once a player starts doing it, they often play more assertively and aren’t as afraid of making mistakes. That positive mindset can snowball into overall better performance. Physically, completing the motion can reduce injury risk – pulling up short can put strain on the brakes (like decelerating muscles, joints). A smooth follow-through lets the body dissipate force more naturally (think of it like follow-through in throwing to protect the arm). So in the long run, they’ll feel less stiff after hitting.
Common Mistakes When Fixing: A common mistake is confusing follow-through with swing path. Some players will “follow through” by exaggerating an awkward finish pose without actually having accelerated through contact. For example, they’ll swing and kind of place the racquet over their shoulder at the end because coach said finish high, but they actually slowed down at contact and then lifted the racquet to the shoulder. This is just posing, not a true follow-through. The fix is to ensure the speed through the ball is there – the finish should be a result of that momentum, not a forced position

. Another mistake is losing balance because they are not used to the full rotation that a follow-through encourages. They might spin too much or step weirdly. This is usually temporary – as they get used to completing the swing, their body will adjust to the new finish (also incorporate good footwork to stay balanced). Some players might over-rotate their torso on the follow-through (especially if they were holding back before); they might end up with their back nearly facing the net and lose sight of the ball. The remedy: remind them that rotation is good but head should still stay relatively fixed until the swing is done (don’t spin your head with your body). Lastly, an occasional psychological mistake: after a couple of balls fly long (maybe due to initial overhit), the player reverts to not following through. Correcting this requires trust that proper topspin and aim will bring the ball in. Usually those long balls are because the player hasn’t added the topspin component yet or is swinging on too low-to-high a trajectory. They should adjust the trajectory or spin, not eliminate the follow-through. Stick with it, and soon the full finish becomes second nature, and those balls start dipping in with topspin instead of sailing. As Coach Bollettieri advised, “Hit and exaggerate the follow through” – rarely will an exaggerated finish do harm

, whereas a cut-short swing certainly will.
